# random-world

random-world creates a string by guessing each character of the string until the string matches "random word!" and then printing it out. The application itself serves no useful purposes except for me to learn [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). 

Set up rust by following the [getting started instructions](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started)

# build & run

```
cargo build
cargo run
```
